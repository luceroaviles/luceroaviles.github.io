		<h2>Let our furry friends help you destress!</h2>
			<p>If you have ever been lucky enough to own a dog or a cat, you probably don’t need scientific studies to tell you what you already know:your pet makes you feel better. He or she gives you unconditional love, after all. They seems to know what you’re feeling, and mirrors those feelings back to you. They can make you laugh, and they can even make you cry. All of those feelings,love, sharing, empathy, and more pick you up when you’re feeling down and they make you feel less stressed.</p>
			<p>If you aren't able to have them around (not due to allergies) we have a group of charming furry friends that would love to help you feel that happines.</p>
			<p>While not a full website yet my friends at <a href="http:www.generalassemb.ly">General Asembly</a> will help me build this site and many others.</p>
